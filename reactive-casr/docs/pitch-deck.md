# Reactive CASR - Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: Title
**Reactive CASR**
Cross-Chain Automated Stop-Rebalance

*Revolutionizing DeFi with Reactive Smart Contracts*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
### Current DeFi Challenges

- **Manual Monitoring**: Users must constantly watch their positions
- **Cross-Chain Complexity**: Managing positions across multiple chains is difficult
- **Slippage & MEV**: Delayed reactions lead to significant losses
- **Gas Inefficiency**: Multiple transactions for simple rebalancing
- **No Automation**: No way to automatically respond to market conditions

**Result**: DeFi users lose money due to delayed reactions and manual processes

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
### Reactive Smart Contracts for DeFi

**Reactive CASR** leverages Reactive Network's innovative technology to:

- **Automatically Monitor**: Real-time position monitoring across chains
- **Instant Response**: Sub-second reaction to threshold breaches
- **Cross-Chain Execution**: Seamless operations across multiple blockchains
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient REACT gas usage with configurable budgets
- **User-Friendly**: Simple dashboard for position management

**Core Innovation**: First dApp to demonstrate meaningful reactive workflows in DeFi

## Slide 4: How It Works
### The Reactive Workflow

```
1. User Creates Position
   ↓
2. Reactive Network Monitors Events
   ↓
